    "\n",
    "[1] Planning Document Find an interesting dataset and describe the system you plan to build out. If you would like to use one of the datasets you have already worked with, you should add a unique element or incorporate additional data. (i.e. explicit features you scrape from another source, like image analysis on movie posters). The overall goal, however, will be to produce quality recommendations by extracting insights from a large dataset. You may do so using Spark, or another distributed computing method, OR by effectively applying one of the more advanced mathematical techniques we have covered. There is no preference for one over the other, as long as your recommender works! The planning document should be written up and published as a notebook on GitHub or in RPubs.Please submit the link in the Unit 4 folder, due Thursday, July 5."

    "The rapid growth of data collection has led to a new era of information. Data is being used to create more efficient systems and this is where Recommendation Systems come into play. Recommendation Systems are a type of information filtering systems as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are realted to the search history of the user.\n",

    "They are used to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other: Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. Moreover, companies like Netflix and Spotify depend highly on the effectiveness of their recommendation engines for their business and sucees.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Demographic Filtering- They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.\n",

    "2. Content Based Filtering- They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.\n",

    "3. Collaborative Filtering- This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts."
